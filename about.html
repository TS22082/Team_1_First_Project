                <p class="lead ">Doulaville is a collective of birth and postpartum doulas who have
                    chosen
                    to come together to further
                    the
                    professionalism and quality of doula care in the San Francisco Bay Area.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    As birth professionals we understand our role as non-medical support people. We are present to
                    nurture
                    our
                    clients and encourage positive, open communication with medical care providers. Our doulas have
                    undergone
                    formal training, participate in continuing education, and are screened to ensure safety of your
                    family.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Each member of Doulas of the East Bay is a unique individual with varying interests, experience and
                    training. We encourage you to take the time to interview more than one doula and to ask each doula
                    about
                    her
                    philosophy, experience, and training. Through this process you can help to ensure a good fit and a
                    positive experience with your doula.
